# Viaduct

A configuration management framework written in Go.

My motivation behind this is because I really like the idea of being able to
compile your configuration management code and distributing it in a single
cross-platform binary.

It also has the advantage of being able to write your configuration in a fully
fledged language, similar to Chef with Ruby.
