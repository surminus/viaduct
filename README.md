# Viaduct [![CI](https://github.com/surminus/viaduct/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/surminus/viaduct/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

A configuration management framework written in Go.

My motivation behind this is because I really like the idea of being able to
compile your configuration management code and distributing it in a single
cross-platform binary.

It also has the advantage of being able to write your configuration in a fully
fledged language, similar to Chef with Ruby.
